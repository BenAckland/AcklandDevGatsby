This series will cover how I built this blog using GatsbyJS and hosted it in Azure Static Web Apps for free. It'll also deep dive into some of the issues I encountered using apex domains and application insights.

## Intro

I have intended to start blogging for a long time. The intention is to use it as a public notebook to document the things I learn as I learn them. My hope is that by being public it will be helpful to others but will also help me. Teaching a topic requires you to learn it and order your thoughts in a way reading about it never can.
